# voodoo
Clojure/ClojureScript library for binary byte buffer manipulation reminiscent of C

## Rationale
Parsing binary bytes of data in Clojure/ClojureScript is a pain in the butt. Parsing binary bytes of data in C/C++ is simply.  This library simulates C structs and pointer arthimatic to allow use parsing of binary data.
